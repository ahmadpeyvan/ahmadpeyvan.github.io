This paper enables the construction of generalizable and interpretable approximate Riemann solvers using neural operators. Its framework can be extended to learn high-fidelity solutions of hypersonic flow fields, including discontinuities such as shocks and contact waves. Moreover, the proposed architectures are scalable to 2D and 3D configurations, making them suitable for rapid surrogate modeling in complex aerospace applications.
